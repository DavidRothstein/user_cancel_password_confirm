User Cancel Password Confirm
============================

The User Cancel Password Confirm module allows users to cancel their accounts
with password confirmation rather than e-mail confirmation.

Normally, the account cancellation process within Backdrop core requires users
to confirm their desire to cancel their own accounts by receiving an e-mail and
clicking on a link within it. For some sites, this workflow is not desired.
This module replaces it with a (equally secure) workflow where the user is
allowed to cancel their account immediately by typing their password on the
confirmation screen that appears after they initiate the account cancellation
process.
